# Jinga Exchange Portal

Jinga Exchange is a one-stop portal, offering a platform for people to exchange money without any physical money transfer from one country to another. It standardizes and systemizes the existing practice of manual money exchange between acquaintances, by introducing transparency and convenience without sacrificing security.

The mutual exchange must consist of two individuals both in foreign countries who want to exchange money at an agreed rate. A requestor expresses interest to exchange in a specified country and a partner desiring to exchange money will find the request and accept.

The transfer of money to respective beneficiary accounts takes place automatically when both parties pay the respective amount to their IMEX account.The transaction is reversed when at least one party fails to make payment within a specified period (eg 48 hours).
