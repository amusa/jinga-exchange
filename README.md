# Jinga Exchange

## Overview
Jinga Exchange is a one-stop portal, offering a platform for people to exchange foreign currencies without the physical movement of money between countries. It standardizes and systemizes the existing practice of manual money exchange between acquaintances, by introducing transparency and convenience without sacrificing security.

Money exchange on Jinga platform is a bipartite transaction involving two currencies respectively, and both parties must agree on a conversion rate. 

## How it Works
A requestor puts up an exchange request in a specified currency, and a willing party having the reverse currency finds the exchange request and proposes a rate. Several proposals can be made as long as the request is open.

The requestor reviews the various proposals and accepts the best proposal. Each actor must have at least 10% of the amount involved in the respective currencies in order to request or propose an exchange.

Once the exchange proposal is accepted by the requestor, money is then exchanged between both party's Jinga account subject to the availability of fund in the respective accounts. 

The transaction is reversed when at least one party fails to fund his or her account to complete the transaction within a specified period (eg 48 hours).
